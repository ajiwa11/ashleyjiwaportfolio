    <h2>So, What do we do?</h2>  

    <h3><b>Meet Ashley</b></h3>

    <p>With over 20 years of experience in <a href="#ethical">ethical</a> elephant training, Ashley has worked with elephants in various environments, from wildlife sanctuaries and zoos to traveling circuses and conservation projects. Known for a gentle yet firm approach, Ashley focuses on building trust and mutual respect between humans and elephants.</p>
    <p>Our mission is simple: to create lasting, positive change in the way humans interact with elephants, ensuring their well-being and promoting conservation efforts worldwide.</p>

    <h3><a name="ethical">Ethical Training Approach</a></h3>

    <p>At Ashley's Elephant Training, we are committed to humane and ethical training practices. We never use physical force or harsh techniques. Instead, we employ positive reinforcement, patience, and understanding to encourage natural behaviors and facilitate communication.</p>

   <p>Our approach is rooted in the belief that elephants are intelligent, emotional beings with their own preferences, needs, and social structures. By respecting these qualities, we foster an environment where both elephants and humans thrive.</p>
